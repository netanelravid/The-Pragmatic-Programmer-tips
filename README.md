# The Pragmatic Programmer tips
After a lot of books and tutorials I've read on *'How to programming in language X'* and *'How to Use framework Y'* I've search for a new book.
I've look for a book which will contribute me in a different way, something which will make me one step closer to be a better software developer, more than a language-framework-skill user.

This book make me to realize that code writing its just a side effect as a developer.

Right now I'm reading this book and I'm collecting some tips during my journey.
I will write here some tips from time to time, hope it will be useful to you.

I've also include the tips which already mentioned in the book, it will be colorized)

The TPP book tips will be :book:

My tips will be :black_nib:

**Note: Read the book!! those tips are just a good-to-keep cheatsheet**

**Note 2: Please feel free to correct me or add some advices of your own**

- :black_nib: *Kaizen* - every day, work to refine the skills you have and to add new tools to your repertoire.

## *1. A Pragmatic Philosophy:*
#### **Intro**
- :black_nib: Approaching - think beyond the immediate problem, place it in its larger context.
#### *The Cat Ate My Source Code*
- :black_nib: When you take responsibility for a project, you should expect to be held accountable for it, don't blame someone or something else.
3. :book: Provide options, don't make lame excuses
#### *Software Entropy*
4. :book: Don't live with broken windows
- :black_nib: When the project you're working on is:
    - Messy and ugly - stop coding and take care for the mess you're facing with.
    - Clean and beauty - keep up with the clean way and don't fall for "fire rages" (deadlines, release date, demos, etc.)
#### *Stone Soup And Boiled Frogs*
- :black_nib: Work out what you can reasonably ask for.
- :black_nib: People find it easier to join an ongoing success.
5. :book: Be a Catalyst for change
- :black_nib: Its often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams.
6. :book: Remember the big picture
- :black_nib: Constantly review what's happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.
#### *Good Enough Software*
- :black_nib: Its unprofessional to promise impossible time scales and to cut basic engineering corners to meet a deadline.
7. :book: Make quality a requirements issue
- :black_nib: Great software today is often preferable to perfect software tomorrow.
- :black_nib: Don't spoil a perfectly good program by over-embellishment and over-refinement.
#### *Your Knowledge Portfolio*
- :black_nib: Your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets, but unfortunately they're expiring assets.
- :black_nib: Managing your knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio.
- :black_nib: Build your portfolio:
    - *Invest regularly* - Invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly, even small amount.
    - *Diversify* - the more different things you know, the more valuable you are.
    - *Manage risks* - in the terms of risk-reward standards, the technology spectrum is pretty wide, don't pull all your technical eggs in one basket.
    - *Buy low, sell high* - learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be priceless.
    - *Review and rebalance* - the industry is very dynamic, you should review what you learn, to keep in mind that it's relevant.
8. :book: Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio
- :black_nib: Goals:
    - Learn at least one new language every year.
    - Read a technical book each quarter.
    - Read non-technical books.
    - Take classes / online course.
    - Participate in local user groups / meetups.
    - Experiments with different environments, change one in a while your tools set (OS, IDE, etc..)
    - Stay current, keep updated with magazines about different technologies.
    - Get wired, connect to newsgroups to get the ins and outs of new language/technology you want to get into
- :black_nib: The process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilities and new ways of doing things.
- :black_nib: Always have something to read in an otherwise dead moment
9. :book: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear

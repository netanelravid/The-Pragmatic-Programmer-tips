# The Pragmatic Programmer tips
After a lot of books and tutorials I've read on *'How to programming in language X'* and *'How to Use framework Y'* I've search for a new book.
I've look for a book which will contribute me in a different way, something which will make me one step closer to be a better software developer, more than a language-framework-skill user.

This book make me to realize that code writing its just a side effect as a developer.

Right now I'm reading this book and I'm collecting some tips during my journey.
I will write here some tips from time to time, hope it will be useful to you.

I've also include the tips which already mentioned in the book, it will be colorized)

- :black_nib: Approaching - think beyond the immediate problem, place it in its larger context.
#### *The cat ate my source code*
- :black_nib: When you take responsibility for a project, you should expect to be held accountable for it, don't blame someone or something else.

##### *Software entropy*
4. :book: Don't live with broken windows
- :black_nib: When the project you're working on is:
    - Messy and ugly - stop coding and take care for the mess you're facing with.
    - Clean and beauty - keep up with the clean way and don't fall for "fire rages" (deadlines, release date, demos, etc.)
